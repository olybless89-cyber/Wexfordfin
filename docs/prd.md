## 4. Business Rules and Logic

### 4.1 Authentication and Authorization
- Users register with email and password
- Two roles exist: \"user\" and \"admin\"
- Role-based route protection: Users access user dashboard, admins access admin dashboard
- Password reset flow sends email with reset link

### 4.2 Account Creation
- Upon registration, system automatically creates three accounts for user: checking, savings, business
- Each account is assigned a unique account number
- Initial balance for all accounts is zero

### 4.3 Transaction Processing
- Internal transfers: Instant completion, balances updated immediately
- External transfers: Validate recipient account number, update balances for both parties, create transaction records
- Transaction statuses: pending, completed, failed, held
- Transactions with holds cannot be completed until hold is released

### 4.4 Deposit and Withdrawal Requests
- Users submit requests, which enter \"pending\" status
- Admin reviews and approves or rejects
- Upon approval: Balance updated, transaction record created, status changed to \"completed\"
- Upon rejection: Status changed to \"failed\"

### 4.5 Holds Management
- Admin can place hold on user funds with specified amount and reason
- Held funds are not available for withdrawal or transfer
- Admin can release hold, making funds available again

### 4.6 Email Notifications
- Welcome email sent on registration
- Email sent on login from new device
- Email sent on deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
- Email sent when admin places hold with reason
- Email sent when admin releases hold

### 4.7 Admin Actions Logging
- All admin actions (funding accounts, placing/releasing holds, approving requests) are logged

### 4.8 Data Storage
- Backend uses Supabase for authentication, PostgreSQL database, and Edge Functions
- Database schema includes tables: users, accounts, transactions, holds, deposit_requests, withdrawal_requests, notifications, admin_messages
- RLS policies enforce data access control

## 5. Exceptions and Edge Cases
